PolyCalX
--------

A colorful, concise text-based calendar widget for Android.

The color coding is intended to be especially useful for people who must
coordinate multiple calendars.

It is relatively simple, at least by Android project standards, and attempts
to use the standard practices for each part. By default, it has no calendar
permissions, and so it will be in "screenshot mode" (which was also used to
prepare the app widget preview).

Tested on Android 10 and 13 (API 33).

## Install & Settings

For the moment use the APK in the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/lrq3000/PolyCalX/releases/latest).

After you place the widget on your homescreen, make sure to tap on it to open the settings, and then tap on "Calendar Permission"
to allow the widget to access your calendar. Otherwise, by default, it shows fake data as an example.

You can also select which calendars you want to show (each in a different color - use another app such as Etar to modify the colors).

The date/time format can also be changed.
